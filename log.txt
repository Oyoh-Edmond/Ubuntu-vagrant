Error after running "Vagrant up" initial 

    A host only network interface you're attempting to configure via DHCP
already has a conflicting host only adapter with DHCP enabled. The
DHCP on this adapter is incompatible with the DHCP settings. Two
host only network interfaces are not allowed to overlap, and each
host only network interface can have only one DHCP server. Please
reconfigure your host only network or remove the virtual machine
using the other host only network.

Solution
- Check VirtualBox Network Settings
- Remove Conflicting Host-Only Network:
- Reconfigure Vagrant:
    specified the network settings by configuring a private network 
    with a static IP address of "192.168.50.10". 

error solved.
